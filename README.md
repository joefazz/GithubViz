# Github breakdown challenge

## Instructions

Complete the `GithubBreakdownScreen` component by adding a visualisation of some interesting statistics of the users repo e.g. a breakdown of the users repos by main language. You can get this information from the Github API (it will probably be easier to use the REST one, but if you want to use the GraphQL one that's fine too).

Feel free to change any of the existing code - in particular, if you don't want to get the user's username and password from Redux that's fine.

Please make your code readable and the visualisations nicely presented.
